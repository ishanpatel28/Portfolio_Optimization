# Portfolio_Optimization
This project implements a mean-variance portfolio optimization model using Python. It downloads historical stock data with yfinance, calculates asset returns, and applies convex optimization via CVXPY to find the optimal asset weights balancing expected return and risk. Includes visualization of portfolio allocation and risk-return tradeoffs.
